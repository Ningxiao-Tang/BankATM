Backend/OOD files

We didn't have a UML, instead we had a shared google doc where we had all the classes organized
in a way where we can see their relationship to one another (it looked very similar to the readME). 
We tried to make our app follow OOD as close as possible, for example for every aspect of the app
we have made a class for it that will inherit from the superclass. The main superclasses were 
AccountType, User, Transaction. We decided to not have a overclass Account for both AccountType and 
User because there isn't much in common between the two, and so we wanted to separate them. 
Transaction was its separate class because just like in Quest where there are Item, here Transaction 
is the "Item" of Bank ATM. For the Currency class, instead of using separate classes for the 
different types of currencies, we decided to go with enum with the file CurrencyType. 
This was because it had a simpler implementation with the same functionality.
